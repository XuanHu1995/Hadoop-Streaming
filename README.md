# Social Networking website with multiple backends.

This project incorporates three types of databases (MySQL, HBase, MongoDB). To implement a social networking website, heterogeneity of data, functionality, and requirements are needed. Therefore, applications usually require developers to incorporate a number of different databases, making use of their respective advantages to achieve better efficiency and performance. As a result, in a network of databases, even a single request made by the front-end of will trigger requests to many internal back-end services to retrieve fresh information.

Databases:
1. MySQL
We will be using Amazon's RDS MySQL, which is a Database-as-a-Service(DBaaS). In DBaaS, cloud providers offer packaged database services which users can #configure and deploy# while the cloud provider performs the #traditional database administration and maintenance functions#. The database can seamlessly scale based on load. They are maintained, upgraded, and backed-up by the cloud provider.
